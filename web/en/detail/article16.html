		<h1>Announcement: Rent function temporarily closed</h1>
		<h3>Dear players:</h3>
		<p>Since CryptoGladiator starts public beta, we have found a bug that clone CD would be extended indefinitely when renting gladiator, which has affected the normal experience of the game. We apologize for the following decision: We will temporarily close rent function and start repair work.</p>
		<p>Players who have already encountered this bug should please don't be worry and wait patiently for this repair work to be completed. In the next version, we will complete this repair, and your gladiator will return to normal.</p>
		<p>In order to ensure the normal repair work,please let your gladiator off the renting shelf so as to avoid unpredictable losses.</p>
		<p>We are very sorry for the inconvenience, thank you for your support and understanding!</p>
		<p style="text-align: right;">Official team</p>
