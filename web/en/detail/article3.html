		<h1>BATTLE CLASS</h1>
		<p>In the game there are multiple attribute categories that determine the strength of a Gladiator. These are collectively referred to as the Combat Attributes. They include: basic attributes, element attributes, weapons, and skills. </p>
		<p>Basic attributes refer to: HP, speed, strength, strength, which also include the Element attributes: Wind, Water, Fire, and Fire. They have a correlated relationship with each other so when multiple attributes are combined, you can get various additional percentage damage bonuses.</p>
		<p>In addition to these two attributes there are weapons and skills. Gladiators with strong basic attributes will have a good foundation but what will really determine the outcome are the weapons and skills attributes. When powerful weapons and skills are triggered, some can instantly deal high damages, others can add various types of control effects and the rest can affect the gains and deductions to their own or opposing camps, allowing them to take advantage of own weapons and skills. </p>
